Hi, thanks for participating in this experiment.
Now you are going to receive some instructions and will be trained before we begin the experimental task itself. 
If you have any questions during the instructions or the training do not hesitate to ask
Press ENTER to initiate the instructions.
In this task we are going to present you some problems to solve.
In each problem we are going to present you three words.
For each triad of words, you must come up with a solution.
The solution is a word that can be associated with all three words of the triad to form a compound word or a phrase. 
For example: AGE, MILE, and SAND form the compounds STONEAGE, MILESTONE, and SANDSTONE. Therefore, the solution to this triad is the word STONE.
Do you have any questions? If not, please press ENTER to continue.
Note that the solution-word can be either a suffix or a prefix to the three words. For example: STONEage and mileSTONE.
Before each trial a fixation cross will be displayed. The triad will be displayed where the fixation cross is, so pay attention to it.
You will have 15 seconds to read the words and come up with a solution. 
Once 15 seconds have elapsed you will be prompted to provide an answer. 
It is imperative that you PROVIDE THE ANSWER RIGHT AWAY! If you don’t know just press ENTER.
Do you have any questions? If not, please press ENTER to initiate the training.
